            Njah properties is a privately owned group of properties offering comfortable, well maintained accommodations to our tenants.
We aim to provide quality living at an affordable, friendly environment. As a testament to this, most of our tenants have been with us for 2-15 years.
Our team will work with you to provide you with the best living environment. We are a pet friendly property company.
I am personally involved in the evaluation, inspection and purchase of our properties. I am also involved in the redesign and modifications of existing properties to make sure they meet our high standards. Our new structures are similar designed to meet the high expectations of our company.
We look forward to working with you, if you find that one of our available properties will satisfy your housing needs.
